# ReadQuest  
*Enhancing Language and Literacy Through Gamification*

ReadQuest is an educational platform designed to improve children's reading comprehension and literacy through gamified learning. Students complete interactive reading rounds, earn rewards, and track their progress â€” all while tutors monitor performance and adjust difficulty based on live metrics.

>  **Note:** This project is currently in **Alpha**. Some features and endpoints are incomplete or broken. Expect bugs and placeholder content.
